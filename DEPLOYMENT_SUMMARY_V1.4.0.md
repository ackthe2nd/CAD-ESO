# Resgrid to ESO Bridge - Deployment Summary v1.4.0

## Latest Improvements (May 7, 2025)

This version includes critical improvements to unit data handling, Google Sheets integration, and unit time extraction. The major fixes address issues with units not appearing in Google Sheets, duplicate unit names, and improved time tracking.

### Key Improvements

1. **Fixed Unit Data in Google Sheets**
   - Units now correctly appear in the Google Sheets export for all calls
   - Enhanced code to check both Activity and Dispatches arrays for complete unit information
   - Fixed issue where units assigned to calls but without status updates were missing

2. **Eliminated Duplicate Unit Names**
   - Prevented duplicate unit listings like "STN1, STN1" in both XML files and Google Sheets
   - Implemented JavaScript Set for deduplication while maintaining unit order

3. **Added Google Sheets Row Updates**
   - Calls now update existing rows in Google Sheets instead of creating duplicates
   - Added "Last Updated" timestamp column to track modification times
   - Improved error handling with graceful fallback to append mode if update fails

4. **Enhanced Unit Time Extraction**
   - Now using direct StatusId values (5=En Route, 6=On Scene, etc.) for reliable data
   - No longer affected by "Unknown" StatusText values
   - Better fallback logic for Cleared and Back In Service times

## How to Deploy

1. **Download and Extract**
   ```
   tar -xzf resgrid-eso-bridge-deployment-final-fixed.tar.gz -C /path/to/destination
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` with:
   - Resgrid credentials: RESGRID_USER, RESGRID_PASS
   - SFTP settings: SFTP_HOST, SFTP_USER, SFTP_PASS, SFTP_DIR
   - Google Sheets: LOG_SHEET_ID, GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON (or related settings)

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Process Existing Calls**
   ```
   node final-with-sheets-fix.js --days=7
   ```

5. **Start Listener for Real-time Updates**
   ```
   node listener.js
   ```

## Google Sheets Integration

This version maintains the Google Sheets columns from previous releases but adds a "Last Updated" column and ensures units are correctly displayed. The sheet format remains compatible with previous versions.

## Testing & Verification

After deployment:
1. Run a test by processing recent calls: `node final-with-sheets-fix.js --days=1`
2. Verify in Google Sheets that:
   - Unit names appear correctly without duplicates
   - Calls with known units show those units instead of "No Units"
   - Last Updated column shows current timestamps
   - Existing calls update their rows rather than creating duplicates
